### How to use the parser?

1. Go  to yandex.ru / yandex.com and select the category "pictures"
2. There is a camera icon next to the "find" button, click it.
3.Upload a photo of the item you like to parse
4. As a result, click once on one of the “similar photos” presented in the section. You will be redirected to a new page. 
5.Copy URL of this page
6. Then go to the YandexGraber.py script, find the line wd.get ('') and insert your URL here
7. Run the script from the console: python YandexGraber.py
If the download went quickly, much faster than an hour, this means that there was an "incomprehensible glitch", which is somehow connected with Yandex, I haven't figured it out yet. It is treated by restarting the script. In general, the expected time is about 2 hours for 1500 images. You may have other numbers.
8. The result is in the data folder
9. Then you can clean the folder from some broken images that were downloaded, as well as from duplicates, for this run the script clean_data.py
10. A new clean_data will appear.
